DESCRIPTION:
File Integrity Checker:
💡 Introduction
The File Integrity Checker is a security tool designed to monitor changes in files by calculating and comparing their hash values. This ensures that files remain unaltered and helps detect unauthorized modifications, accidental changes, or file corruption.
🔐 Why File Integrity Monitoring is Important?
- ✅ Security – Detect tampering, unauthorized modifications, or malware injections.
- ✅ Data Integrity – Prevent unintended changes or file corruption.
- ✅ Compliance – Helps meet cybersecurity standards (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).
- ✅ Backup Validation – Ensure backed-up files remain identical over time.

🚀 Features & Functionality
🔎 Core Features
- SHA-256 Hashing – Uses cryptographic hashing to ensure files remain unchanged.
- Automatic File Monitoring – Scans a directory and detects modifications, additions, or deletions.
- JSON-Based Storage – Saves hash values for future comparisons.
- Real-Time Alerts – Notifies users when changes are detected.
- User-Friendly CLI – Simple command-line interface for efficient tracking.
⚡ Advanced Features (Enhancements)
- 📍 Auto-monitor directories at intervals (e.g., every 10 mins)
- 📜 Detailed logs for security audits
- 🚨 Email/SMS alerts for critical file changes
- 🛑 Whitelist trusted modifications to reduce false alarms
- 📊 Graphical dashboard for file monitoring (if converted into a web app)
